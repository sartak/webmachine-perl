    NEW FEATURES:
        - A resource class can now provide a default_charset() sub. This is
          called if the client does not pass an Accept-Charset header,
          allowing you to ensure that responses are always encoded as
          bytes. (Dave Rolsky)
        - Both charsets_provided and default_charset can return string, rather
          that key/value hashref pairs. These strings are assumed to be
          character set names, and Web::Machine will use Encode::encode() to
          turn the body into bytes with that string. (Dave Rolsky)
        - Started working on a new Web::Machine::Manual document, and tweaked
          some of the other docs in the distro. (Dave Rolsky)

    MISC:
        - Fix test failures on 5.17.x. (Dave Rolsky)
        - Tests on older Perls would fail when trying to parse a date in
          2112. Reported by Bernhard Graf. (Dave Rolsky)


0.10 Mon. Apr. 15, 2013

    MISC:
        - Requests with an If-None-Match error caused an undef warning if your
          resource did not return a value from the generate_etag() sub (Dave
          Rolsky)
        - Content negotiation is generally smarter. If a client asks for
          "utf8" and your resources provides "UTF-8", this will be considered
          a match. This is all implemented in HTTP::Headers::ActionPack 0.05
          but it affects Web::Machine. (Dave Rolsky)
        - If you actually implemented charsets_provided in a resource this
          would cause Web::Machine to die with an error like 'Can't locate
          object method "HASH(0x2f613f8)" via package My::Resource'. (Dave
          Rolsky)
        - None of the body filtering code for applying encodings or charset
          encoding actually work when the body was returned as an
          arrayref. (Dave Rolsky)
          - tests for all of this

0.09 Wed. Mar. 27, 2013
    MISC:
        - Malformed headers no longer cause a 500 error (Greg Oschwald)
            - added tests for this

0.08 Tue. Feb. 12th, 2013
    NEW FEATURES:
        - It is now possible to have the create_path
          resource method fire *after* the entity is
          processed. This resolves RT #78631, which
          also has an excellent description of the
          problem in it.
            - added tests for this

0.07 Thu. Jan. 24th, 2013
    MISC:
        - fixing some broken test dependencies

0.06 Wed. Jan. 23th, 2013
    COMPATABILITY BREAKAGE:
        - removed the $metadata variable in the FSM
          and moved this into the PSGI $env instead
            - blame Jesse Luehrs if this is a problem
        - Content-Type is a required header (Jesse Luehrs)

    NEW FEATURES:
        - implement PSGI style streaming responses (Jesse Luehrs)
            - added tests for this
        - allow IO handle responses (Jesse Luehrs)
            - added tests for that

    MISC:
        - fix some tests (Jesse Luehrs)
            - skiping them properly
            - not relying on header order
            - fixing typos

        - when a resource throws an error, log this to the logger defined in the
          Plack::Request object if one is available (Dave Rolsky)
            - added test for this

0.05 Mon. Oct. 29th, 2012
    - if a resource returned undef from is_authorized this caused an
      uninitialized value warning (Dave Rolsky)

0.04 Sun. Sep. 9th, 2012
    - moves all the content negotation code to
      HTTP::Headers::ActionPack
        - adjusted the Util module accordingly
        - added/adjusted tests accordingly

    - improve the bind_path function in Util
        - improve existing and add more tests for this
        - improve the docs on this too

0.03 Tue. Jun. 19th, 2012
    - fixing a missing semicolon (thanks to bricas)
    - fixing missing $VERSION numbers (also thanks to bricas)
    - allow the resource to choose how to handle exceptions
      instead of always writing them to the body
        - adjusted tests accordingly

0.02 Sun. Jun. 17th, 2012
    - forgot to add some dependencies

0.01 Tue. Jun. 12th, 2012
